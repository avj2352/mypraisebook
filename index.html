<h1>Praise Adonai</h1>
<p><small>Song by: Paul Wilbur | Link:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh9VVdfyNLk" target="_blank">Youtube Link</a></small></p>
<p><small>Bridge:</small><pre>
	Praise Adonai
	From the Rising of the Sun
	To the End of every day
	Praise Adonai
	All the nations of the Earth
	All the angels and the saints sing praise
</pre></p>
<p><small>Stanza:</small><pre>
	Who is Like Him
	Lion and the Lamb
	Seated on the Throne
	Mountains bow down
	Every Ocean Roars
	To the Lord of Hosts
</pre></p>
